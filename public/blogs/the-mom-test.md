# What?
This is a pretty famous book by Rob Fitzpatrick. Supposedly, it talks about customer sales and is *life changing*. I'll be the judge of that.

# Ok, so they're right. This is *AMAZING*. Here's my Notes:
**What is The Mom Test?**

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3. Talk less and listen more

**General Points**

- ***When pitching ideas, don’t talk about your idea if you want actual insight and not useless pity.***
- Rule of thumb: You're shooting blind until you understand their goals.
- There’s a difference between*: “I-will-pay-to-solve-that” vs “thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it”*
- Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.
- Ignore ALL compliments—this shows that you went into pitch mode. Redirect by asking questions.
- While using generics, people describe themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN—don’t interrupt, it is bad manners and loses valuable perspective and information.
- Start broad with questions, only zoom in if you realize that it’s a problem.
- 3 BIG QUESTIONS should be READY before interview
- Product risk vs. Market Risk — if you have a product that people actually want, the risk isn’t “market”, its whether the product itself can be created
- Keep it casual—don’t waste time scheduling long meetings initially, you can get information in a couple minutes.
- Meeting “Currencies”—the success of a meeting depends on how much they’re giving up (e.g. time, money, or connections)
- Create your own meeting places: gives you credibility and easy connection to industry experts.
- Calls are terrible: no body language, more formal, and casual vibes.
- Meetings—Keep having them until you stop learning new things.
    - If you don’t know what you’re trying to learn, what’s the point?
    - Have a cofounder on call to take notes and make sure you’re not tripping.
    - Take NOTES and REVIEW meetings
- Don’t have broad customer segments, as that makes your product less specialized.
    - Always start specialized, and then generalize.
    - Reachable, profitable, and rewarding
    - *“Startups don’t starve, they drown”*
- Sometimes, you can just “Hack the Knot”. Don’t get too caught up on this.
